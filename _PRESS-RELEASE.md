There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Groupon Exchange.

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Groupon Exchange is an app targeting users who want to spend on a budget.

## Summary ##
  > Groupon exchange is an app that will allow user to find, save, and share coupons available at different shops. The app will provide a list of stores where coupons can be found and are valid. Coupon descriptions (time of valid use, product coupon can be used on, etc) will also be provided. 

## Problem ##
  > The two problems my app solves are allowing others have more access to coupons outside of the newspaper and gives users more chances to save money.

## Solution ##
  > My product elegantly solves this problem by using Google Maps api to allow a user to find stores advertizing coupons for their products. Every coupon found is another chance to save money.

## Quote from You ##
  > "If you are looking for high quality at a low price, look no further".

## How to Get Started ##
  > A user gets started by pressing the "Find Coupons" button on the gome page. You will then be sent to a map displaying stores advertizing coupons based on your current location. 

## Customer Quote ##
  > "I've saved $1000 just this month thanks to the amount of coupons I was able to take advantage of thanks to Groupon Exchange!".

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
